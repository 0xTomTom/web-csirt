## Summary

On the third of February 2022, a new Zero-day XSS Vulnerability in Zimbra was published on the internet. Zimbra is an open source email platform that is used by a variety of organisations. Volexity detected on the 14th of December a campaign containing two attack phases. The first (reconnaissance) phase was used to track if a target received and opened the message(s). The second (delivery) phase was used to lure targets into clicking on a malicious link. For the attack to be successful, the target would have to visit the attacker's link while logged into the Zimbra webmail client from a web browser. By visiting the attacker's link, can the session of the receiver be obtained, this gives the attacker access to the account of the victim.

## What you can do
* Users of Zimbra version 8.8.15 need to re-apply the patch (P30) to obtain the fix for this vulnerability 
* or should consider upgrading to version 9.0.0
