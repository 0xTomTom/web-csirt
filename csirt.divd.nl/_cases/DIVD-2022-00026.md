## Summary

Due to improper validation of user input, a malicious actor could upload an arbitrary file to a user controlled location of the server. By leveraging the arbitrary file upload vulnerability, it is further possible to gain remote code execution on the server.


## Impact

By leveraging the vulnerability, a malicious actor may perform Remote Code Execution by uploading a specially crafted payload (.WAR file), or upload a jsp webshell.

## What you can do

* We recommend you to remediate the vulnerability by following [WSO2's advisory](https://docs.wso2.com/display/Security/Security+Advisory+WSO2-2021-1738) 
* If remediation is not possible, take the instance off the public internet.

* Inspect your installation for web shells (.jsp and .class) by inspecting the logs, e.g. for requests to /fileupload. It is also possible that attackers have deployed a .WAR file, so you might want to check the [wso2carbon log file](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ADMIN44x/Monitoring+Logs) as well.


## What we are doing

* DIVD is currently ensuring that the owners of vulnerable systems are being notified. We do this by scanning for vulnerable hosts, verifying the vulnerability and notifying the owners of these systems. If you receive an email from us regarding this case, the vulnerability has been confirmed.
