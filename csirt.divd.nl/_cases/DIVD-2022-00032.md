## Summary

On 2 June 2022, Eye Security published a [report about a identified backdoor on earlier with ProxyLogon breached Server](https://www.eye.security/blog/winrs-and-exchange-a-sneaky-backdoor). 

## What you can do
Install the Microsoft Exchange patches.
Verify if the backdoor is available on your Microsoft Exchange server by using the following Powershell command:
winrs -r:https://yourexchangeserverurl/wsman whoami

If you receive the following error: "Winrs error: Access is denied." Then is your system probably equipped with a backdoor by an malicious actor.

## What we are doing

We are currently working to identify the backdoor's on Exchange Servers that are accessible from the internet and warn owners.
