## Summary

On 2 Jun 2022, Volexity published a (report about an exploitation of Confluence)[https://www.volexity.com/blog/2022/06/02/zero-day-exploitation-of-atlassian-confluence/]. Volexity has been in contact with Atlassian who released [a formal advisory](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-security-advisory-2022-06-02-1130377146.html).

What we know so far:
* Affected products are Confluence Server and Confluence Datacenter (both on-premise products)
* The vulnerability was found in version 7.18.0
* Versions >= 7.4.0 have been confirmed to be vulnerable too
* Other versions may be vulnerable
* The vulnerability is an unauthenticated Remote Code Execution
* There is no patch available

## What you can do

If you are using Confluence Server or Data Center it is recommended that you either:
* Severely restrict access, or
* Disable the service

If that is unfeasible, a WAF that blocks requests containing `${` may provide additional protection, but there is still a severe risk.

## What we are doing

We are currently working to identify Confluence instances that are accessible from the internet and warn owners.

We will be sharing the Dutch part of the data with the [Dutch Digital Trust Center](https://www.digitaltrustcenter.nl/dreigingsinformatie-ontvangen) who will inform affected Dutch companies
