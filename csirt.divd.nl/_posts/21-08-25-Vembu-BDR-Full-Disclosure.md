## Context

On 15 May 2021 we published case {% divd DIVD-2020-00011 %}, which dealt with four vulnerabilities in Vembu BDR and related products. These four vulnerabilities here confidentially reported to Vembu in November 2020 and again in Februari 2021.

From recent scan data we know that of these four vulnerabilities three have practically seized to exist online:
* {% cve CVE-2021-26471 %}
* {% cve CVE-2021-26472 %} 
* {% cve CVE-2021-26473 %}

Therefore we have decided to release the full technical details on these vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability {% cve-2021-26474 %} is still present on the internet. Therefore we are not releasing details on that vulnerability, yet.

The details of the vulnerabilities can be found in the links below:
* {% cve CVE-2021-26471 %}
