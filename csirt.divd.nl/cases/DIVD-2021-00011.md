## Summary
On 2 July 2021, Kaseya published a notification advising to disable your on-premise Kaseya VSA servers immediately.

## What you can do
Follow the [official advisory](https://helpdesk.kaseya.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4403440684689-Important-Notice-July-2nd-2021) from Kaseya:
> We recommend that you IMMEDIATELY shutdown your VSA server until
you receive further notice from us.

> Its critical that you do this immediately, because one of the first things the attacker does
is shut off administrative access to the VSA.

## What we are doing
The Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD) performs a daily scan to detect vulnerable Kaseya VSA servers and notify the owners directly or via the known abuse channels, Gov-CERTs, and other trusted channels.

We have identified this server by downloading the paths ‘/’, ‘/api/v1.5/cw/environment’ and ‘/install/kaseyalatestversion.xml’ and matching patterns in these files.
