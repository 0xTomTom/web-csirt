## Summary

On 24 August 2022, Atlassian released a security advisory for CVE-2022-36804.

The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a Bitbucket Server instance, however a prerequisite for exploitation is that at least one repository is set to public access for anonymous users.

All versions released after 6.10.17 including 7.0.0 and newer are affected, this means that all instances that are running any versions between 7.0.0 and 8.3.0 inclusive are affected by this vulnerability.

Exploitation likeability is high, as the exploit code is readily available.

## What you can do

Users with this vulnerable versions should update as fast as possible. Atlassian released updates for all affected versions.

We recommend ACLs to limit access to the Bitbucket environment to trusted users, an practical example would be to only allow access to the console from the local/virtual network your infrastructure is running on.

Review whether your public repositories are public purposefully or by accident. You can review this in the repository details page and change the visibility of the repository if needed.

We suggest to inspect your sever logs for any suspicious activity.

## What we are doing

We are scanning the internet for vulnerable Bitbucket instances, and will notify system owners via the listed abuse contacts.
