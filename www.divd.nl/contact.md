We are a network of security researchers who mainly work online. If you want to contact us, you can send us an e mail to "question" at divd nl. Most likely, our chairman Victor will answer, or forward your mail to Chris or Astrid. You can also meet us at cyber security conferences and hacker events or just follow us on Twitter.
